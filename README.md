    Customizable: Designed for easy retraining with new datasets.
    Scalable for Deployment: Can be integrated into web or mobile applications.
    Insights for Analysis: Offers detailed metrics and visualizations.

Technologies Used

    Programming Language: Python
    Deep Learning Framework: TensorFlow/Keras
    Model Architecture: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
    Data Handling: Pandas, NumPy
    Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn

Dataset

The dataset contains images from two primary categories:

    AI-Generated Images: Includes images generated by GANs, diffusion models, and other AI techniques.
    Real Images: Contains authentic photos from cameras and natural sources.

Images are organized in folders, with separate directories for training, validation, and testing.
Usage
Training the Model

    Prepare your dataset in the required format with train, val, and test folders.
    Run the training script to build and fine-tune the CNN model for classification.

Making Predictions

Provide an image for prediction, and the model will output the likelihood of the image being AI-generated or real.
Model Training and Evaluation

    Preprocessing:
        Images are resized to 224x224 pixels.
        Pixel values are normalized.
    Augmentation:
        Random rotations, flips, and zooms are applied to enhance model robustness.
    Training Parameters:
        Optimizer: Adam
        Loss Function: Binary Cross-Entropy
        Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall
    Evaluation:
        Accuracy, confusion matrix, and ROC curve are generated.

Results

    Accuracy: Achieved 99% on the validation set.
    Precision: 98.5%
    Recall: 98%
    F1-Score: 98.25%

Sample predictions and performance metrics can be found in the results/ folder.
